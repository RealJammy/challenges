        <li>Each tape has been preloaded with some data.</li>
        <li>For each position n, the byte on T1 at position n represents the position of T0[n] in the final flag.</li>
        <li>For example, if the flag was 'flag', T0 would have something like f,a,l,g, and T1 01,03,02,04.</li>
        <li>The flag data starts at the beginning of the tapes.</li>

    Notes:
    <ul>
        <li>Input is disabled: the input instruction will always return 0.</li>
        <li>The maximum number of instructions that can be executed has been limited to 50000. This is more than enough for this challenge. (Therefore, infinite loops won't work :p)</li>
